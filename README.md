# scrintal-chrome-extension

## About the project
[Scrintal](https://www.scrintal.com/) is a great hybrid note-taking & mind mapping whiteboard solution that is evolving at a rapid pace.

This Scrintal browser extension is just to bridge the time until templates are natively supported.

Due to the currently high update frequency of the solution, it may happen that this extension no longer works at some point.

This project is not directly related to Scrintal, but is an unofficial, personal project.

## How to use
Due to the security restrictions of the browsers, there is basically only one way to use this extension at the moment:

1. [Download](https://github.com/nmboris/scrintal-chrome-extension/releases/latest/download/scrintal-chrome-extension.zip) the .zip file of this extension, save it somewhere on your computer and unzip it.
1. In the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser, open the "Extensions" menu
1. Activate the "Developer Mode"
1. Press the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder of the downloaded extension.

After the extension has been activated, it makes sense to pin it via the browser's extension button so that it can be accessed with one click directly from the address bar.

_Happy Note Taking :)_
